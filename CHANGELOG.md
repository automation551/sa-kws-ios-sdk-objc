CHANGELOG
=========

2.1.9
 - Fixed a warning in KWSRandomName.m; Now when I push to Cocoapods I do so w/o any warnings;

2.1.8
 - Repaired KWSLeader and KWSLeaderboard models to have proper framework / static lib handling headers

2.1.7
 - Added a random name generator method for the KWS SDK
 - Added a fourth paramter to the main "setup" method, which is a App Id (integer); This is needed in order to have random name generator work w/o a logged in user.
